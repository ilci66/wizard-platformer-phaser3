# Wizard's Quest
A fun prject I'm building in my free time to learn web development and just have fun I guess.

## Challanges
Well, everything...
Loading tiles now and Figured out how to basically interact with tiled. My main issue is the sprite hitbox now. It's alot smaller than my sprite. Gonna do some reading later to fix that
